GUI Assignment: Creating Your First Web Page
Joshua Hou
9/7/21

A simple webpage with navigation linking to my github and a about me. 
In this webpage, a table, random num script, and image is used.
There is also an alert.

<link> refers to my css style sheet located in css folder.

<script> runs my scripts file script.js

<div> I created a container for all tags nested in there for my css.

<nav> is my navigation menu.

<footer> I created my table in there because it seemed like a good UI.
